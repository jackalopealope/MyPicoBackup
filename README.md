This is for my raspberry pi pico, I based this off of https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky you can get better instructions there.
I put the circutpython uf2 file on the pico ofter plugging it in to my computer while holding the BOOTSEL button then copied everything else in this repo other than the
UF2 files once it unmounted and remounted itself and I was good to go.
